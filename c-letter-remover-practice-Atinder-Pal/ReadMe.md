# C# Letter Remover Practice

This application works as follows:
It takes a string from user and asks user to input letter(s)/character(s) to be removed from the input string.
It then outputs the string after removing the input letter(s)/character(s).
It also prompts the message to press esc key to exit
If user hits esc the program exits otherwise it keeps performing the operation recurringly.

I also added new feature where it informs the user which letter(s)/character(s) that he/she wants to remove are already not present in the input string.
