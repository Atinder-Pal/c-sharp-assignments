This is a Grade Translator app created in C#.
The app asks user to check their equivalent Letter Grades when they input their scores/marks/numeric grades.
Following are the rules of conversion from Numeric Scores to Letter Grades:

Numeric Grade       Letter Grade

97-100              A+
                    
90-96               A             

85-89               A-       

80-84               B+

75-79               B

70-74               B-            

65-69               C+

60-64               C

55-59               C-

50-54               D

0-49                F

One feature that was added later was: To show History of all the grades that the user has checked to give an overview to the user.
